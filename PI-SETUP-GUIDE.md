# SAFe Program Increment (PI) - Setup Guide

## Quick Start (2 Minutes) ‚ö°

The fastest way to demo PI features:

1. **Open your Jira project**
2. **Create or edit 2-3 issues** and add these labels:

### Example 1: PI Objective
- **Summary:** `PI 25.1 Objective: Migrate to Microservices Architecture`
- **Labels:** `PI-25.1`, `PI-Objective`
- **Description:** (Optional) Add business value, success metrics

### Example 2: PI Risk
- **Summary:** `Risk: Microservices complexity overwhelming team`
- **Labels:** `PI-25.1`, `Risk`, `ROAM-Owned`
- **Description:** (Optional) Add mitigation plan, owner

### Example 3: PI Feature
- **Summary:** `Feature: API Gateway Implementation`
- **Labels:** `PI-25.1`, `Feature`
- **Description:** (Optional) Add story points, acceptance criteria

3. **Test the queries:**
   - "Show PI 25.1"
   - "Show PI 25.1 risks"
   - "Generate PI 25.1 report"

**Done!** Your PI support is working. ‚ú®

- `ROAM-Owned` üë§ - Risk has assigned owner working on it
- `ROAM-Accepted` ‚ö†Ô∏è - Risk accepted by stakeholders
- `ROAM-Mitigated` üõ°Ô∏è - Risk has mitigation plan in place

   - Story points planned
   - Risk distribution

2. **PI Objectives**
   - Business value scores (extracted from description)
   - Linked to PI version

3. **Features & Capabilities**
   - Story points (extracted from description)
   - Current status
   - Sortable tables

4. **Risks by ROAM Status**
   - Color-coded by status
   - Priority levels
   - Distribution charts

5. **Automated Recommendations**
   - Based on risk status
   - Capacity planning
   - Risk management insights

## Advanced: Automated Data Creation

If you want to populate Jira with sample data automatically:

### Option 1: Simplified Script (7 items)
```bash
node scripts/create-pi-data-simple.js
```
Creates:
- 2 PI objectives
- 2 PI features
- 3 PI risks (one of each main ROAM status)

### Option 2: Full Script (20+ items)
```bash
node scripts/create-pi-data.js
```
Creates:
- PI 24.4 (completed) with objectives, features, and risks
- PI 25.1 (current) with objectives, features, and risks

**Note:** These scripts may experience MCP connection timeouts. Manual label addition is faster and more reliable for demos.

## Tips for Demos

1. **Start Simple:** Create just 2-3 issues with PI labels
2. **Show ROAM:** Demonstrate risk filtering with ROAM statuses
3. **Generate Report:** Show the comprehensive PI report generation
4. **Emphasize Value:**
   - Enterprise SAFe support
   - ROAM risk framework
   - Multi-PI tracking
   - Automatic analytics

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Queries return no results?**
- A: Check that labels are exactly: `PI-25.1` (not `PI25.1` or `PI 25.1`)

**Q: ROAM filtering not working?**
- A: Ensure risk has both `Risk` label AND a `ROAM-*` label

**Q: Report shows "Unknown" PI?**
- A: At least one issue needs a `PI-X.Y` label

**Q: Scripts timing out?**
- A: Use manual label approach instead - it's faster and more reliable!
